# Component Wishlist

The prooph component wishlist is our "todo" list. We want to share it with you.
So you always know what is going on at prooph, who will take care of new features and most importantly:

**Is there something on the list you can help with?**

If you want to become a core contributor to one or more features on the list, drop us
a request in our chat: [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/prooph/improoph)

## Status Caption

- **in progress**: development is in progress but it is not production ready.
As soon as the first stable release is available the component will be moved from wishlist to the [official components list](components.md)
- **planned**: Will be developed in the near future. Ask the maintainer if you want to help.
- **requested**: Would be a good addition but we are looking for maintainers or will implement it later. If you would like
start working on it please drop us a note.
