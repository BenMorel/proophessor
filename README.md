# Proophessor 
Exploring prooph components

Welcome at prooph! We are developing and supporting CQRS and EventSourcing infrastructure for PHP 5.5+ environments.
Proophessor is NOT a framework. Instead we provide components which address individual topics.

## Documentation

Documentation is [in the doc tree](docs/), and can be compiled using [bookdown](http://bookdown.io).

```console
$ php ./vendor/bin/bookdown docs/bookdown.json
$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t docs/html/
```

Then browse to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

## Example Application

Try out [proophessor-do](https://github.com/prooph/proophessor-do) and [pick up a task](https://github.com/prooph/proophessor-do#learning-by-doing)!
