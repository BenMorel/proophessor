# proophessor

CQRS + ES for ZF2

Proophessor combines [prooph/service-bus](https://github.com/prooph/service-bus), [proop/event-store](https://github.com/prooph/event-store) and [prooph/event-sourcing](https://github.com/prooph/event-sourcing) in a single ZF2 module. Goal is to simplify the set up process for a full featured CQRS + ES system.

## Planned Key Facts
- Default configuration to get started in no time
- Transaction handling
  - wrap command dispatch with a transaction
  - link recorded events with command to ease debugging
- Synchronous and asynchronous event dispatching
  - Sync dispatch within the command transaction to make sure that read model is always up to date
  - Async dispatch, the event store will act as a job queue so that multiple worker can pull events from it
- Common command and event objects to ease communication between prooph components and reduce translation overhead
- Apigility support
  - Messagebox endpoint for commands
  - Read access to the event store
- ZF2 developer toolbar integration
  - monitor commands and recorded events
  - replay event stream to a specific version
- Snapshot functionality for aggregates

## Installation

### Proophessor Module
Of course proophessor is available on packagist. Simply add `"prooph/proophessor" : "dev-master"` to your composer.json.
As this is a ZF2 Module you need to enable it in your `application.config.php` with the module name `Prooph\Proophessor`.

### Event Store Schema

By default proophessor connects to a RDBMS using the [doctrine adapter](https://github.com/prooph/event-store-doctrine-adapter) for prooph/event-store.
The [stream strategy](https://github.com/prooph/event-store#streamstrategies) defaults to a SingleStreamStrategy using a table called `proophessor_event_stream`.
There are two ways available to create this table:

#### Using Doctrine Migrations

The recommended way is to use doctrine migrations. Therefor you need to install the [doctrine-orm-module](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineORMModule)
and use the appropriate CLI commands of the module to create and run migrations.
Proophessor ships with a `EventStoreSchema` class which you can use in a migrations script to set up the event stream table.

```php
<?php

namespace Application\Migrations;

use Doctrine\DBAL\Migrations\AbstractMigration,
    Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Schema;
use Prooph\Proophessor\Schema\EventStoreSchema;

/**
 * Auto-generated Migration: Please modify to your need!
 */
class Version20150429205328 extends AbstractMigration
{
    public function up(Schema $schema)
    {
        EventStoreSchema::createSchema($schema);
    }

    public function down(Schema $schema)
    {
        EventStoreSchema::dropSchema($schema);
    }
}
```

#### Using SQL

If you don't want to use doctrine migrations or doctrine at all (there are also other event store adapters available)
you can use the SQL located in the `scripts` folder to create the event stream table manually.

## Configuration

As a ZF2 dev you should be familiar with the way of configuring things in a ZF2 application. The module groups everything
related to the CQRS + ES infrastructure under the root config key `proophessor`.

### Event Store Adapter

One of the crucial configuration points is the database connection for the event store. Proophessor assumes that you have
a doctrine connection defined called `orm_default`, because this is the default when using the doctrine-orm-module
mentioned above. However, you can override the default with a dedicated connection or even another adapter for the event store:

#### Configure Own Doctrine Adapter Connection
```php
<?php
//In your own module.config.php or in the application autoload/local.php
return [
    'proophessor' => [
        'event_store' => [
            'adapter' => [
                'options' => [
                    'connection' => [
                        'dbname' => 'my_db',
                        'driver' => 'pdo_mysql',
                        'host' => 'localhost',
                        'user' => 'root',
                        'charset' => 'utf8',
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

#### Use Another Doctrine Connection Alias

```php
<?php
//In your own module.config.php or in the application autoload/local.php
return [
    'proophessor' => [
        'event_store' => [
            'adapter' => [
                'options' => [
                    'doctrine_connection_alias' => 'event_store_default'
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

### Event Store Features

to be defined ....

### Service Bus Utils

Command/event bus utilities like a custom invoke strategy or a logger can be added via configuration.
Checkout the [module.config.php](config/module.config.php) for details.

### Command Routing

The command bus is set up with a [CommandRouter](https://github.com/prooph/service-bus/blob/master/docs/plugins.md#proophservicebusroutercommandrouter).
The routing map can be defined in the configuration. Checkout the [module.config.php](config/module.config.php) for details.

### Event Routing

The event bus is set up with a [EventRouter](https://github.com/prooph/service-bus/blob/master/docs/plugins.md#proophservicebusroutereventrouter).
The routing map can be defined in the configuration. Checkout the [module.config.php](config/module.config.php) for details.


## Usage

### Retrieving The EventStore

The ProophEventStore can be retrieved from the service manager by using the alias `proophessor.event_store`.

### Retrieving The CommandBus

The ProophServiceBus command bus can be retrieved from the service manager by using the alias `proophessor.command_bus`.

### Retrieving The EventBus

The ProophServiceBus event bus can be retrieved from the service manager by using the alias `proophessor.event_bus`.
