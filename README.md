# Proophessor 
Exploring prooph components

Welcome at prooph! We are developing and supporting CQRS and EventSourcing infrastructure for PHP 5.5+ environments.
Proophessor is NOT a framework. Instead we provide components which address individual topics.

Therefor, proophessor is only a meta package giving you an overview of the prooph ecosystem and acting as a starting point
for those who are new to the world of messaging and event sourced domain models.

*Note: Proophessor started as a Zend Framework 2 integration module for prooph components. But things have changed.
All prooph components now ship with `container-interop` compatible factories and therefor provide interoperable framework integration.
A module, bundle, bridge or whatever is no longer needed to integrate prooph in your web framework of choice.*
